## **About**
- The dataset contains data on people's financial standing and reputation, with the aim of identifying those who are likely to default on a loan payment. To achieve this, you can use a binary classification model that predicts the probability of an employee defaulting on a loan based on the variables provided. By training the model on historical data where the loan default status of each employee is known, you can predict the loan default status of new employees based on their features.

## **Columns:**

- Employed: This column shows whether or not the person is currently employed. 

- Bank Balance: The amount that the person currently has in their bank account is shown in this column. Usually, it is expressed as a currency value, like USD.

- Annual Salary: Indicates the person's yearly earnings. This is also represented in a currency value, just like the bank balance.

- Defaulted: Indicates whether the person has ever fallen behind on a loan or other financial commitment.
